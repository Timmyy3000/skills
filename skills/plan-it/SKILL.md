name: plan-it
description: Create interactive, Lavish-backed product or technical implementation plans for substantial features, architecture changes, frontend/backend work, cross-repo work, and user requests that need review before coding. Use when the user asks to plan, create a feature plan, implementation plan, technical plan, product plan, phased plan, or a visually reviewable plan artifact.

# Plan It

Create a reviewable implementation plan as a Lavish HTML artifact, using the target repo's own design language and the local planning template when available.

## Dependency Check

Before planning, verify that the `lavish` skill is available.

1. Check the active skill list and common local skill paths:
   - `$CODEX_HOME/skills/lavish`
   - `~/.codex/skills/lavish`
   - `~/.agents/skills/lavish`
   - `<workspace>/.agents/skills/lavish`
2. If `lavish` exists, read its `SKILL.md` and follow its workflow for creating, opening, polling, and ending the Lavish review session.
3. If `lavish` is missing, install or restore it before continuing when a known source is available. Prefer the user's local skill installer or configured skill repository. If no source is discoverable, tell the user Lavish is required and ask for the install source.
4. Use `npx -y lavish-axi ...` for Lavish commands. Do not assume `lavish-axi` is globally installed.

## Planning Workflow

1. Clarify only blocking ambiguity. Otherwise infer a practical scope from the repo, the request, and nearby docs.
2. Inspect the target project before writing the artifact:
   - Workspace or repo agent instructions: `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.agent/`, `.agents/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
   - Existing plan templates: files named like `PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`, `plan-template.md`, `implementation-planning-guide.md`, or templates under docs/planning folders
   - Existing plan folders: paths named like `plans`, `agent-plans`, `planning`, `docs/plans`, `docs/agent-plans`, or repo-specific equivalents
   - Frontend styling: Tailwind config, CSS variables, theme files, component library, shared layout components, brand assets, screenshots
   - Backend conventions: contributing guide, test commands, migrations guide, API docs, architecture docs
3. If the target repo has a frontend design system, make the Lavish HTML artifact visually match it. Use the product's tokens, spacing, typography, component shapes, and color behavior where practical.
4. If no local design system is discoverable, use Lavish's fallback design guidance. Run `npx -y lavish-axi design` if needed.
5. Open every Lavish playbook that matches the artifact content before writing HTML:
   - `plan` for implementation plans
   - `diagram` for architecture, flow, state, or sequence diagrams
   - `comparison` for options or current-vs-target behavior
   - `table` for dense work breakdowns, risks, or acceptance matrices
   - `input` when the artifact asks the user to choose scope, priority, or tradeoffs
   - `code` when showing files, APIs, schemas, or diffs
6. Create the artifact at `.lavish/<descriptive-plan-name>.html` unless the user requested another path.
7. Run `npx -y lavish-axi <html-file>` to open the review session, then `npx -y lavish-axi poll <html-file>` to receive annotations and layout warnings.
8. Fix fresh error-severity layout warnings before asking the user to review. If warnings are persistent or low-severity, proceed with a short note.
9. Apply user feedback, poll again with an agent reply, and end the session with `npx -y lavish-axi end <html-file>` when review is complete.
10. After the user accepts the plan, export or save a read-only HTML archival copy in the appropriate repo plan location. Do not archive the editable Lavish working file as the accepted plan.

## Plan Content Standard

Use the local plan template when one exists. Discover it from repo instructions first, then from conventional template names such as `PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`, `plan-template.md`, or `implementation-planning-guide.md`.

Every plan artifact must include:

- Feature overview: problem, users, source docs, success outcome
- User stories
- Scope: in scope, out of scope, dependencies, assumptions
- Phases with goals, work items, impacted files/systems, and exit criteria
- Acceptance criteria
- Test plan with concrete commands where discoverable
- Risks, mitigations, and rollback/fallback notes

For backend work, include:

- Query optimization plan when data access changes
- N+1 prevention notes for relation-heavy endpoints
- Detailed unit test cases
- Migration plan, using the repo's migration-generation command when applicable
- Coverage target and command when the repo requires local coverage

For frontend work, include:

- Data path from user action to backend response and UI model
- State management and caching/invalidation approach
- Loading, error, retry, empty, and permission states
- Responsive behavior and accessibility checks
- Visual acceptance criteria tied to the target design system

For cross-repo work, include:

- Repo-by-repo phases
- Contract boundaries and sequencing
- Separate validation commands per repo
- Companion plan locations when the workspace requires self-contained repo plans

## Accepted Plan Archive

When the user accepts the plan, store a read-only HTML version in the repository so it can be reviewed, shared, and committed without needing the Lavish editor session.

1. Create the archival file from the final accepted artifact. Prefer `npx -y lavish-axi export <html-file> --out <archive-path>` when available so local assets are inlined into a portable HTML file. If export is unavailable, write a standalone read-only HTML copy that removes editor/session affordances and keeps the final reviewed content.
2. Choose archive locations by inspecting repo instructions and existing folders:
   - First follow any explicit instruction in `AGENTS.md`, repo docs, contributing guides, or planning guides.
   - Then prefer an existing repo-local plan folder, such as `docs/agent-plans/`, `docs/plans/`, `plans/`, `.agent/plans/`, or another clearly named local equivalent.
   - In a multi-repo workspace, save a self-contained copy in each affected repo when that repo has a plan folder or explicit plan convention.
   - If a workspace-level coordination folder already exists, optionally save a second copy there only when local instructions or the user request call for workspace coordination.
   - If no plan folder or instruction exists, ask before creating a new convention. A conservative suggestion is `docs/plans/`.
3. Keep accepted archives self-contained. They must not merely link to workspace-only files or a local Lavish session, because repos may be reviewed independently or shared with teammates.
4. Name files with a stable, descriptive kebab-case slug, for example `<feature-name>-plan.html`.
5. After archiving, report every saved archive path and clearly distinguish the editable `.lavish/...html` working artifact from the read-only accepted archive file.

## Artifact Guidance

Make the HTML artifact useful as a decision surface, not a prose dump.

- Put the primary decision, scope, and phase map near the top.
- Use tables for phase plans, acceptance criteria, risks, and validation commands.
- Use Mermaid for architecture, sequence, state, and data-flow diagrams unless a richer custom visual is necessary.
- Use side-by-side comparisons for options, current vs target behavior, or phased alternatives.
- Include file and system references in compact chips or tables.
- Avoid decorative-only visuals. Every visual section should clarify a decision, sequence, dependency, or risk.
- Prevent horizontal overflow with responsive grids, `minmax(0, 1fr)`, `min-width: 0`, wrapping, and truncation for long paths.

## Output Back To The User

After opening the Lavish session, tell the user:

- The artifact path
- The design source used: explicit user style, target repo design system, or Lavish fallback
- Which local plan template or planning standard was followed
- Any blocking assumptions that need review in the artifact
